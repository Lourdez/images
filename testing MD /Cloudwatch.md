## What is cloud-Watch

**Amazon CloudWatch** monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications

## What It Does
It Collect, access, and analyze your resource and application data using powerful visualization tools.

Improve operational performance using alarms and automated actions set to activate at predetermined thresholds.

Seamlessly integrate with more than 70 AWS services for simplified monitoring and scalability.

Troubleshoot operational problems with actionable insights derived from logs and metrics in your Cloud Watch dashboards.

## Use Cases
### Monitor application performance
Visualize performance data, create alarms, and correlate data to understand and resolve the root cause of performance issues in your AWS resources.

### Perform root cause analysis
Analyze metrics, logs, logs analytics, and user requests to speed up debugging and reduce overall mean time to resolution.

## Monitoring and Observability and Telemetry

Full-stack observability at AWS includes AWS-native, Application Performance Monitoring (APM), and open-source solutions, giving you the ability to understand what is happening across your technology stack at any time. AWS observability lets you collect, correlate, aggregate, and analyze telemetry in your network, infrastructure, and applications in the cloud, hybrid, or on-premises environments so you can gain insights into the behavior, performance, and health of your system. These insights help you detect, investigate, and remediate problems faster; and coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning, proactively react, predict, and prevent problems.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
